This is a simple Online Book Store implemented using Java and MySQL server.

This system provides a login to the admin to perform different functions such as add new books, view books, view sales records and search users. The main functionality of this system is that it provides the access to the customers to add customer details, view books, add to cart and view their cart.

First the ‘LoginPage’ window is loaded when you run the project. There you can login with your username password, and it will direct the user to the respective place depending if it is a customer or an admin.
Also in the LoginPage, a signup option is available where the new users can signup and make an account. Through which they can login to the system later by using the username and the password that was submitted. A forgot Password option is also available to create a new password by providing the correct answer to the security question.
